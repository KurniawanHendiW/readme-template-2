# DataMade README Template

Need to quickly put together documentation for your repo? Copy and paste this template into your README, tweak it, and turn it over to the public (or your fellow coworkers).

## Inspiration

Here are a few examples of well-documented code:

* [usaddress](https://github.com/datamade/usaddress)
* [FusionTable-Map-Template](https://github.com/derekeder/FusionTable-Map-Template)
* [csvdedupe](https://github.com/datamade/csvdedupe)
* [chi-councilmatic](https://github.com/datamade/chi-councilmatic)

## A note on formatting

Text in `*italics*` (as under `Getting Started`) indicates template instructions that should be replaced with text specific to the project. Regular text (as under `Errors and Bugs`) indicates a standard block of text that you can copy/paste directly.

## The template

```
# *Project title*

*Short description of your project, in one or two sentences.* 

## Setup 

### Dependencies

*Provide links and descriptions for the third-party libraries you're having your users install.*

### Installation

* Mac OS X
* Ubuntu
* Windows (if applicable)

### Getting started

*What does your user need to know to get everything ready after installation?*
*Think about databases, config files, and settings.*

## Usage

*Give your users a sense of the workflow for using your project/tool.*
*For a website this might include code for running locally.*
*For an API this might include method and parameter specs.*

## Demo

*Grab a simple block of code that makes use of your project/tool and paste it here.*

## Team

* Who worked on your project? 
* Let your users know with a tasteful bulleted list.
* Add a "contributors" section if you've incorporated pull requests.
